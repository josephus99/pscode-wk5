// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a =2
2
b = 3
3
sum = a + b
5

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

a = 2
b = 3

sum = a + b

if sum % 2 == 0:
    print("The sum", sum, "is an even number.")
else:
    print("The sum", sum, "is an odd number.")


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

numbers = []

# Read in 5 separate numbers
for i in range(5):
    number = float(input("Enter number {}: ".format(i + 1)))
    numbers.append(number)

# Calculate the average of the five numbers
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers
smallest = min(numbers)
largest = max(numbers)

# Write out the results
print("The average of the five numbers is:", average)
print("The smallest number is:", smallest)
print("The largest number is:", largest)
